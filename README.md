## Project Title
Robotic Arm Grasping System for RB3 Gen2 Based on Deepseek and YOLO

## Overview
This project presents a robotic arm grasping system for RB3 Gen2, powered by Deepseek and YOLO. The RB3 Gen2 hardware platform provides a solid foundation with its advanced motion control and sensor technology. YOLO is harnessed for real-time object detection, swiftly identifying objects within the environment. Deepseek contributes to the system's decision-making process, analyzing data to determine optimal grasping strategies. Together, these elements enable the robotic arm to perform efficient and precise grasping tasks, with the Qualcomm Intelligent Robotics Product SDK ensuring smooth integration and enhancing the overall reliability of the system.

Before you start, make sure finish [QualComm Intelligent Robotics Product SDK Quick Start]([QIRP User Guide - Qualcomm¬Æ Linux Documentation](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70018-265/quick-start_3.html?vproduct=1601111740013072&version=1.4&facet=Qualcomm Intelligent Robotics Product (QIRP) SDK)


## Quick Start with uArm Swift Pro

1. Download [uArm-Python-SDK](https://github.com/uArm-Developer/uArm-Python-SDK.git)


```bash
git clone https://github.com/uArm-Developer/uArm-Python-SDK.git
```
2. Installation
```bash
   python setup.py install
```

## ü¶æ Project Overview

This project is based on the uArm Swift Pro robotic arm, which mainly consists of the following components:

- **End Effector**: Equipped with a suction pump, used for picking up and moving Mahjong tiles.
- **Drive System**: Composed of four servo motors, each controlling one degree of freedom (4-DoF), enabling precise and smooth motion control.
- **Control System**: An integrated controller that supports both Arduino and Python development environments, serving as the core control unit of the robotic arm.
 
> ‚ú≥Ô∏è The uArm Swift Pro is a four-axis (4-DoF) robotic manipulator known for its high precision and repeatability, making it ideal for lightweight object manipulation and interactive gaming tasks.
